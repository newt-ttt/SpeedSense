Preface: Don't worry if you don't have a secret_tokens.py file yet -- it will be generated on the first run of the server

First, run 'python manage.py makemigrations WebApp'
then, 'python manage.py migrate'
then, 'python manage.py runserver'
and the server will be running and accessible on http://localhost:8000 by default!
